Dựa trên hình ảnh bạn chia sẻ, tôi thấy đây là một section "Tại sao chọn AIPartners?" với 3 feature cards có style khá colorful và playful. Để chuyển sang style B2B chuyên nghiệp hơn, đây là prompt tôi đề xuất:

Prompt cho Replit:
"Redesign the 'Why choose AIPartners?' section to have a professional B2B appearance. Make the following changes:
Overall Layout:

Keep the 3-column grid layout but increase spacing between cards
Add more white space and reduce visual clutter
Use a cleaner, more structured approach

Color Scheme:

Replace the bright colorful icons (purple, green, orange) with a monochromatic or muted professional color palette
Use navy blue, dark gray, or charcoal as primary colors
Add subtle accent colors like light blue or teal for highlights
Ensure high contrast for readability

Typography:

Use a more corporate font family (like Inter, Roboto, or similar sans-serif)
Make headings bolder and more prominent
Increase line spacing for better readability
Use consistent font weights and sizes

Icons & Visual Elements:

Replace colorful circular icons with minimalist line icons or simple geometric shapes
Use consistent icon style - either all outline or all filled
Reduce icon size and make them more subtle
Consider using grayscale icons with subtle color accents

Cards Design:

Add subtle shadows or borders instead of bright backgrounds
Use white or very light gray card backgrounds
Add more padding inside cards
Consider adding a subtle hover effect
Make corners slightly rounded but not overly playful

Content Presentation:

Make the descriptions more concise and business-focused
Add bullet points or structured text if needed
Ensure consistent text alignment

Call-to-Action:

Make the 'Tham gia cùng chúng tôi' button more professional
Use a solid color button with good contrast
Consider changing button text to something more B2B appropriate like 'Get Started' or 'Learn More'

The overall goal is to make it look trustworthy, professional, and suitable for business decision-makers rather than consumer-focused.
